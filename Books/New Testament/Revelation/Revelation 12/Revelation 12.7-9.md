There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war. They didnâ€™t prevail. No place was found for them any more in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
