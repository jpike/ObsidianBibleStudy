In Matthew 6:25, Jesus states that we should not be worried/anxious about our lives (food, drink, clothing, etc.):

![[Matthew 6.25|Matthew 6:25]]

What are the reasons for this?

Well, Jesus starts off this statement with "Therefore".  That means what comes before (or potentially after) can provide more insight into the reasons behind this directive.

# You Can't Serve God and Mammon

What comes immediately before this statement?  Well, that's what's below:

![[Matthew 6.24|Matthew 6:24]]

Jesus asserts that you can't serve both "God" and "Mammon".  [Mammon generally means wealth or possessions](https://biblehub.com/greek/3126.htm):
<iframe src="https://biblehub.com/greek/3126.htm#movebox2" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

Trying to serve both can be dangerous, as this verse indicates.  You can only serve one master, and a split focus can be emotionally dangerous.  By trying to serve any other master, you'll either wreck your relationship with God (hating Him while loving the other master) or can experience hatred toward material things that would hinder you from being able to properly enjoy and be thankful for God's material gifts.

If you are serving God, then you can trust in His provision:

![[Matthew 6.32|Matthew 6:32]]
![[Matthew 6.33|Matthew 6:33]]

If you are serving mammon (wealth), then that will be your pursuit:

![[Matthew 6.32|Matthew 6:32]]

Any time those physical possessions become threatened, that can introduce anxiety.  Since God is eternally existent and omnipotent, He cannot be threatened like these things.

# What does it look like to serve God?

If we can only serve one master, and serving masters other than God can lead to worry/anxiety, what does it look like to serve God?

There's a little bit of an example a bit earlier in Jesus' sermon on the mount in Matthew 6:

![[Matthew 6.19|Matthew 6:19]]
![[Matthew 6.20|Matthew 6:20]]
![[Matthew 6.21|Matthew 6:21]]

# What constitutes life?

In Matthew 6:25, one of the reasons Jesus gives for not worrying about our lives is that life is more than just these material possessions:

![[Matthew 6.25|Matthew 6:25]]

If life is "more" than just these things, what else constitutes life?

Overly worrying - incorporating an over-focus on these things - can hold one back from experiencing all that life has to offer - an abundant life.

# Worrying Doesn't Help Solve Your Problems
Jesus ultimately gives multiple reasons to not worry, though there's an interesting subtle one given in the midst of this discussion in the sermon on the mount:   

![[Matthew 6.27|Matthew 6:27]]

This question is made in the context of worrying about "life" or very basic "essentials" for our lives - food, drink, and clothing.

Jesus points out that worrying (being anxious) can't ultimately solve these problems by increasing one's lifespan.

In other words, when problems occur, worrying isn't really the path to solving those problems.

# What kinds of things do we worry about?
Matthew 6:25-33 mentions things like life, food, drink, and clothing as things people can worry about.  What are some other things people might worry about in our modern cultural context?
- Jobs
- Money
- Shelter
- Health

# Trusting in God's Provision
Another key theme that Jesus brings out in the Matthew 6:25-34 section of the sermon on the mount is that we shouldn't worry because we should instead trust for God's provision:

![[Matthew 6.26|Matthew 6:26]]
![[Matthew 6.28|Matthew 6:28]]
![[Matthew 6.29|Matthew 6:29]]
![[Matthew 6.30|Matthew 6:30]]
![[Matthew 6.31|Matthew 6:31]]

You'll notice that one of the reasons given with that has to do with the value of a human (a being made in God's image).  Jesus here asserts that if God cares for "lesser" parts of creation, it would be silly for him not to care for parts He'd consider more valuable.

Think about what has God provided historically in the Bible?

And then what has He provided in your life?

# Counteracting Worry/Anxiety

There are a few specific tips given to help with counteracting worry/anxiety.

In the sermon on the mount, Jesus says that we should instead seek first God's kingdom and His righteousness (and then all of "these things" would be given to us as well):

![[Matthew 6.33|Matthew 6:33]]

When we're focused on seeking God, our focus won't be on other things we could worry about.  He will provide other things we might need along the way.

Jesus also indicates to not worry about "tomorrow":

![[Matthew 6.34|Matthew 6:34]]

Worrying about "tomorrow" (the future) can take our focus off the present - today.  Each day is plenty for us, so we should make sure to pray for what we need in the present so that we can be most effective in what we need to do each day.

Paul also writes about how prayer with thanksgiving and bring peace:

![[Philippians 4.6|Philippians 4:6]]
![[Philippians 4.7|Philippians 4:7]]

When we're involved in prayer and petition with a thankful heart to God, we're in frequent communication and trusting in Him and His provision.  That peace can guard us against worry/anxiety.
